# Dictionary Learning with MNIST Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of **dictionary learning** for unsupervised learning on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to learn a dictionary (a set of basis functions) that can efficiently represent the MNIST images using sparse linear combinations.

The dictionary learning approach finds a set of atoms (basis elements) and then tries to represent each image as a sparse linear combination of these atoms. This technique is often used for tasks like compression, feature extraction, and denoising.

## Contents

- **dictionary_learning.py**: Python script implementing dictionary learning on the MNIST dataset.
- **mnist_images/**: Folder containing sample MNIST images used in the experiments (optional).
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- **examples/**: Jupyter notebooks or scripts demonstrating how to train and visualize dictionary learning results on MNIST.
- **output/**: Folder for saving the output, including dictionary visualizations, reconstructed images, and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Dictionary Learning**: Implements the dictionary learning algorithm to decompose MNIST images into sparse representations.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes learned dictionary atoms and image reconstructions.
- **Reconstruction**: Reconstructs original MNIST images from their sparse representations.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the quality of the learned dictionary based on reconstruction error.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Dictionary Learning on MNIST, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `tensorflow` or `keras` installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
